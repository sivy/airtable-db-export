Airtable DB Export documentation
================================


`Airtable`_ is a low-code platform that allows individuals, teams, and businesses to
build database-backed applications. As a low-code tool Airtable is optimized for
non-technical users to be able to create new tables, forms and interfaces quickly.

An individual or organization using Airtable may find that after building a quick solution
or prototype in Airtable, they want to export this data into a structure that is optimized
for use in tranditional developement or for further analysis.

`Airtable DB Export`_ enables developers to download tables of data from Airtable as JSON files,
configure the mapping of Airtable tables and fields to SQL tables and columns, and (currently)
create and load a DuckDB SQL database with downloaded data.
